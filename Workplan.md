# MNXB11 -Team work plan 

**Someone wants to order a pizza but can't be bothered to leave their house.**
*They look up "pizza nearby" and looks for the phone number of the first place that pops up.*
#The pizza gets ordered by phone, is rung up by the cashier, and comes through on the kitchen ticket.

So first of all, obviously, we need to have a dough ball to flatten. 
Luckily, the overnight crew have already prepared BATCHES of dough. 
Then, we need the sauce and the cheese (maybe some olives?).
Call me crazy, but the pizza needs a shower of oregano aswell. 
Also, we forbid pineapple. 

Patrick: Pizza is cooked 

Vidar: Pizza is ready to send
We need to put it in a box, would be a shame to ruin the pizza
Our delivery driver just got back, let's give him the pizza and an adress and send him on his way
